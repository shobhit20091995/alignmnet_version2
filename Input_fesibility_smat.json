  "Project Purpose or Justification": "UC Berkeley does not use energy as efficiently or as wisely as it could, leading to wastage. The project aims to emphasize individual actions through campus outreach to reduce campus and auxiliary energy usage, provide relevant information to stakeholders, and achieve a high participation rate.",
  "Objectives and Scope": "The project aims to develop, launch, and maintain a campus-wide campaign on energy reduction, accompanied by an incentive program for Operating Units. It includes the development of a campaign name, visual identity, website, marketing plan, competitions, energy audits, resources, communication with stakeholders, and coordination with the OE Procurement and IT teams.",
  "High-Level Requirements": "The project requires installation of proposed meters and related software at the beginning of the outreach campaign, demand for energy audits and resources to be met, finalization of decisions from procurement and IT teams affecting energy saving potential, and the buy-in and participation of Operating Units for estimated energy savings to be realized.",
  "Project Description": "The Marketing and Outreach project aims to address the inefficiency and wastage of energy at UC Berkeley by emphasizing individual actions through campus outreach and a campus-wide campaign on energy reduction.",
  "Deliverables": "Deliverables include the development and launch of the campus-wide campaign, creation of a website, energy usage records, visual identity, marketing materials, energy audits, and the roll-out of the campaign to all buildings.",
  "Success Criteria": {
    "1": "Reduced total campus and auxiliary energy usage",
    "2": "Relevant information provided to stakeholders",
    "3": "High Operating Unit participation rate"
  },
  "Start and End Dates": "Start date: Summer-Winter 2011; End date: On-going",
  "Key Dates and Milestones": {
    "Implementation team fully staffed": "July 2011; Summer-Winter 2011",
    "Formalized working relationship with Energy Office": "Summer 2011",
    "Marketing plan and materials developed": "By initial launch: Oct/Nov 2011",
    "Energy audits conducted (with Energy Office)": "Initial set of buildings: by initial launch (Oct/Nov 2011); on-going",

    "Campaign rolled-out to all buildings": "Nov 2011 â€“ on-going"
  },
  "Phases of Work": "Details may change upon the completion of the final workplan",
  "Constraints": "Constraints include assumptions on the implementation of the Energy Office and Incentive Program, potential greater demand for energy audits and resources than supply, finalization of decisions from procurement and IT teams, and the buy-in and participation of Operating Units.",
  "Assumptions": "Assumptions include the implementation of the Energy Office and Incentive Program, availability of resources for energy audits, timely finalization of decisions from procurement and IT teams, and the buy-in and participation of Operating Units.",
  "High-Level Project Risks": {
    "Risk": "Participation may be too low, program may be perceived as not fully successful, and financial savings may not be a sufficient motivator",
    "Mitigation Strategy": "Involvement of Operating Units, assessments and presentation of metrics, and an extensive marketing and outreach campaign"
